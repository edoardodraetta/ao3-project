Steve and Bucky are happy, only, Bucky is afraid to ruin it with a very untraditional way of coping. "Bucky's keeping something from me, Nat." The first couple of chapters are short I know. They'll get longer, promise. Also if you're looking for a set posting schedule.... uh... sorry? I'm only able to post every other day during the week in my first period.





So, yeah, this is a mess. It's the plot of a roleplay I've been doing for like, six months now and it's fucking messed up. So. Uh. Have fun? It gets confusing but I swear I'll try and sum it all up if we ever get to the end.





Once there were two worlds. One is our world that involves a broken family with broken sisters. The other is a golden realm with two princes who both want the throne. But what if those two worlds collide and a romance starts. The eldest sister and the youngest prince might even rewrite the stars. This story does not belong to me, but to Starswim. I just give it my own spin of it. The original book is called: When Storms Come And Stars Collide. I do not own the characters or the plot, my OC is the only one I own.





0921, an assassin trained under H.Y.D.R.A is sent on a mission to kill the Winter Soldier, a fugitive of H.Y.D.R.A. being an experienced assassin/mercenary, this seems like a fairly simple task - kill the deserter and anyone who gets in her way. But what happens when she's instead caught by the Avengers and forced to remember things about her long-lost past? Things she hadn't known she'd forgotten? This story contains graphic depictions of torture, blood, gore, assault, violence and much more! Viewer discretion is HIGHLY advised!





Set after Winter Soldier and Agents of SHIELD season 1, this story explores Wanda Maximoff slowly trusting the Avengers, Bucky Barnes and Steve Rogers falling in love, Kate Bishop and Lucky meeting the Avengers, Peter Parker meeting the Avengers, and becoming Spider-Man, the AoS crew joining the Avengers, and much more! Updated every Wedensday Note on the Timeline: This is set post Winter Soldier, in June 2015. Bucky has been living in the Tower for about six months and has regained most of his memories. The scene at the beginning of AoU happened, except Wanda defected to the Avengers after Pietro was (accidentally) killed by HYDRA fire. Laura Barton doesn’t exist, but Kate Bishop does. Wanda has been with the Avengers for about two weeks now. Iron Man 3 happened, but Tony didn’t blow his suits, and Thor 2 did happen. This is also set post AoS Season 1.





Working under SHIELD’s Damage Control division, she was used to handling shitty situations: wrecked buildings, stranded helicarriers, and alien hostages, to name a few. But a one-night stand with Captain America? Definitely not one of 'em. This it is! I finally fucking did it. This particular story has been in the works for so long, and I can't wait to share it with y'all. I still have a couple things to figure out, but get ready for a wild ride (if you decide to stick around). Thanks so much for reading, comments are always appreciated :) Much love, Levans44





Set after the events of endgame, follow the Barton family as they grieve for Natasha Romanov. "You are strong, a different type of strong. It's better I think. To be strong like you" Dear Reader, I wrote this because I, like many others were not satisfied with how they treated Natasha's sacrifice in Endgame. I wanted to know how Clint told his family, how his kids reacted when they found out that Clint won't be bringing 'Auntie Nat' again. Cooper's reaction to Nat's death is a personal one for me. I felt this way when my grandfather died. I still feel guilty at times when I think about it. Lila's reaction I drew from my love of Natasha's character. She is so complex and changes so much throughout the movies that she feels real. I see her as the strongest avenger, not in physical strength but in emotional strength. Natasha's ability to take all of that pain from her past and change it into drive to be better, to be good is something I really admire. She was willing to give up her life, to bring back the universe. She had a family, the Avengers and gave up seeing them alive and whole again, so that Clint could see his family. She did all of that without hesitation, she was so incredibly strong. I imagine that Lila grew up stronger because of Natasha. Sincerly, Maya





At the end of Iron Man 1, Tony Stark walks into his Malibu home and finds not Nick Fury, but Alexander Pierce waiting for him. Yes, THAT Alexander Pierce. It changes everything. All my stuff is unbeta-ed. Please do me a solid and point out any grammar mistakes in the comments. XD





I_Am_Ironman- This server is for work purposes only, please do not spam or misuse this server. Hawkeyeisthecoolest- suuuuurre snek (he/him)- boo you whore Spider-Man- Did Loki just quote Mean Girls?? shuriwithaB- yes, yes he did This is beyond not canon compliant. Don't expect any correct characterizations, any correct timeline, or even correct spelling. Hope you enjoy!!





"You two need to stop worrying about me. I can look after myself, you know?" "We're your older siblings, it's our job." "... I know." "Stay safe." "Aw come on, it's me we're talking about here." "That's why she said it." **** "I firmly believe that letting me deal with this was a mistake." "You think?" **** "I will not thank you, your ego is bigger that America's nukes." "That is no way to respect your elders, young lady." **** "I'm just a child, not a threat." "You're not a child, you're a weapon." **** "So, you're a lump of walking vibranium. Let's talk about that." "Believe me, I'd rather not." **** "I don't know how you keep fucking this up, Stark. I'm honestly impressed." "I don't need your judgement thank you, Bumblebee." "... What?" "Wow, doesn't even know Transformers. You really did throw your little sister's life away, huh?" **** "Well, I think that went smoothly." "He literally tried to kill you." "And I'm still here, so I take that as it went well."





The world keeps getting stranger. Tom always knew he was odd. He was virtually identical to his father's brother, cosmetic differences aside, so when he learned that he and Loki were actually the same person, it made a degree of sense. It even made sense of his obsession with the older man, though of course that would always look insane to anyone looking in. Then, a multiverse, and magic, but he could handle that. But can he cope with universes colliding? *** The Christmas after Tom graduated from Cambridge changed everything. Or perhaps it just brought those changes to light. Christmas had always been a time of change for Tom. Death of the old to bring life to the new. More like the rituals of the ancient pagan gods his ancestors worshiped than anything else. The death of the Sun, not the birth of the Son. He loved the holiday, no matter what it meant. He’d been given the greatest gift of his life around this time of year, and would be forever grateful for it, even as it was snatched away from him. A story that started out as sketchy porn with feels has evolved into one of the strangest and most epic stories I've ever written. Who knew? This part 3 of a series, and only sort of stands on its own. The primary relationship in this story is immoral and illegal in most of the world, but is not portrayed as exploitative here. No one is currently underage. To any FrostIron fans who stumbled on to this, first, welcome to the weird. Secondly, the Loki/Tony relationship is distinctly secondary, but relevant. And for Loki's sweet sake look at the tags! Most of the chapters will not be this long, I promise.





A collection (hopefully) of one-shots and drabbles of Wanda and Vis being romantic af. If you're like me and have been absolutely decimated by WandaVision this is dedicated to you, please read and be happy in this fluffy alternate narrative. I'll be taking songs from my playlist ( https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6iByx6VGuHvuje9JBAIgjY ) and writing short (or not so short) one-shots about my favourite pair. Requests will be taken, just let me know what you wanna see in the comments and I'll see what I can do. mixtape track #1 ~ Last Dance by Camera Can't Lie In which Civil War never happened and they all lived happily ever after. Wanda and Vision dance at one of Tony’s fancy galas and are forced to address the feelings that have become apparent to themselves, and the rest of the team. Yearning included with a happy resolution after a lil bit of angsty longing.





After weeks of unrest that have put the Avengers through the wringer, everything is finally calming down. Tony is doing better, Winter is doing better and Steve has (mostly of his own free will, thanks Nat) decided that he will tell Tony how he feels. When the remnants of Hydra target one of their own, the Avengers know that they can’t rest until they found every last one of them. Trying to take over the world is one thing. But trying to kill one of them is unforgivable. They aren't called the Avengers for nothing. This is angst with some fluff, and angst and some crack and angst. Also, it’s angsty. Happy Ending guarantied! For everyone new: Welcome to Slow Burn – The Series! If you don’t want to read all the other instalments here a very short summary: A lot had happened, they have all suffered at my hands (sorry?) and are basically just starting to recovery from multiple kidnappings, near death experiences and thinking Tony was dead like 2 or 3 times. Winter is with the Avengers for like a couple of weeks and is still working a lot of stuff out. Important info: he is not Bucky any longer. The chair destroyed his memories. Steve is, in fact gay, but aside from Nat, Clint, Bruce and Thor no one knows. They are all a mess, tbh. For my beloved long-suffering readers: welcome back! I plotted this thing for five days straight. A shoutout to some of you who suffered greatly by listening to my whining. Now: Enjoy! (…or try to…)





On a new planet, Shuri is faced with an unexpected role. She agreed to go on the one-way trip because she was trying to escape heartache on Earth. She believed she would live out the rest of her days working as a scientist helping a fledgling colony thrive. What she learns once she arrives is that she has signed a lifelong contract that involves marriage to a man of the government’s choosing for the purpose of populating the new world. That man turns out to be the asshole passenger she’s had several unlucky run-ins with during her passage to the new planet. Erik disdains the elite scientists who call all the shots. While he could have become one of them, he chose the life of a soldier. He’s used to giving orders as a general but he’s used to taking them as well. That’s why when he is ordered to marry the know-it-all scientist he doesn’t hesitate. It has nothing to do with how perfect he finds her.

Loki died the first day he ran away from home. He became a ghost, hovering over his own body, unable to leave the world until he was free, but no one could hear him, except Bucky. Only those close to death can hear the voices of ghosts. My native language is not English, so I'm sorry if there are any grammatical mistakes. Thank you @FloraFangfei for being my English proofreader.





It's not that the Odinsons could not afford his billables, it's just that Doctor Stephen Strange never signed up for the position. Being Loki of Asgard's personal doctor should come with perks...shouldn't it? Uhm. Hello. Yes, this is my first attempt at writing smut. (Please be nice, thank you!) I know I am behind on replying to comments left on other stories but know that I read and treasure every single one of them. I found myself in a dark place recently and I am still working to get myself out. Thank you for your enduring patience and support.





Set 6 months or so after Part 1 (and better writing quality) Red's all sorted, got an amazing Asgardian girlfriend, an adopted Spidermum, tons of aunts and uncles, cousins and siblings but field trips? getting spontaneously stabbed a lot of the time? running around the globe looking for long lost sisters? nope, never tried that before i.e. I suck at summaries, but please give it a ago. A series following a teenager with Wanda-like abilities featuring Parental Black Widow, Buckey's cookies and good old field trips... Hi, so I really hope you like this work, I started it as a bit of a joke but now in up to almost 150 pages.... so updates will be every 2 days or so! Please comment ideas or leave kudos, it's really appreciated





[based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe] This is the story of Forsaken, a skilled and trained assassin who works for Hydra until she is rescued by Shield. She tries to find her old memories, but there's someone who won't leave her mind. Will Forsaken be able to become her olf self again? tw: this story contains smut, violence, blood, sexual assault, death, and mental ilnesses.





The Avatar has been gone for many years, lost in the war that the old Fire Lord Johann waged against the other nations. The war raged on for two decades, but came to an abrupt end with the Fire Lord's untimely demise. Fragile peace and balance settled over the world afterwards. Seventy years passed since the Avatar's mysterious disappearence and everything changes when Tony Stark discovers the missing Avatar at the South Pole. Avatar Steve never expected to wake up after he opted to sacrifice his life to end the war. Yet there he is, in the future, with everything and everyone he ever knew gone, with the exception of Hoshi, his animal guide. How does Steve fit into this new world that has moved on without him? Does the world still need the Avatar? A conflict brews on the horizon, and only the Avatar can restore balance. Steve can't do it alone. But that doesn't mean he has to. A band of unlikely heroes gathers to face the threat together, as a team. As the Avengers. --- MCU's first Avengers reworked and rewritten in the ATLA universe with some twists and turns, now with more angst and character arcs and friendships. Hey everyone! I have had the idea to write a Marvel/ATLA crossover for a good while now and I have like 20k written already, oops. Originally I thought I'd post this after I finish the story, but at the moment ATLA is a bandwagon so it might be a good idea to post this in the midst of the reneissance. I'm posting this kind of as an experiment to see how many/if people like it. If you do, please leave a comment <3 Kudos and bookmarks are appreciated too! Oh, and just a heads up, no ATLA characters are canon, I just took the setting and put Marvel in it. All tagged characters will appear sooner or later and it might take a while before some of the other Avengers are introduced, but they're coming, I promise. Updates will be probably every two weeks so that I can keep a writing schedule. If all goe well, maybe even weekly, who knows. Won't keep you any longer now, please proceed <3 Story notes: -a turtle duck was mandatory for this story -timeline is a bit wonky but hopefully it will be clearer as the story progresses -i totally made up all the physics surrounding icebreakers, glaciers, flamethrowers, and so much more This chapter is dedicated to my physics teacher who would probably have none of that nonsense but bear with me i haven't had physics class in months. Special thanks to my pals Moni and Marko who sort of beta read the stuff I already have and gushed about it. Plus Moni helped me with a lot of the ideas and I owe her a lot, thank you! <3
