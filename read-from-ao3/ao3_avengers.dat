Day Twenty-Eight by OBlossom
“Attention all staff and students. We are in lockdown. This is not a drill. Please initiate all lockdown procedures. I repeat, we are in lockdown. This is not a drill.” There was barely a second between the end of the announcement and Mister Harrington jumping into action. He ushered some of his students into the corner of the room while directing one to cover the window in the door and others to push and stack tables in front of the now locked door. It was something out of an alternate reality. Peter looked at Ned, who was wide eyed and terrified, but determined. “What do we do, Peter?” Peter shrugged helplessly and led Ned to the corner with all the others as he tried to think. Honestly, Peter wasn’t sure what to do. He and Mr. Stark had never really talked about lockdowns. It was always aliens and robberies and the like, so it seemed he needed to figure this one out on his own.

Cat Got Your Tongue? by ChocolateCapCookie for tonbotomoe
"Did you ask Tony if you could keep him?” asked Natasha, who’d finished her coffee and was now eyeing the kitten with mild amusement. “No,” said Steve. “Should I?” “I mean, it is his Tower.” Clint poked at the kitten, quickly pulling his hand back when the kitten went into a defensive stance. “I don’t think he’d like having competition.”

Vol. 1 by SuperSaiyanMagenta for AveChameleon, RoyalBlueRoses, OwlFeathers (AngelofAlderaan), mozarteffect
Guardians of the Galaxy as a Vegebul tale with lots of gender swaps and very perverted Vados starring as Groot! Disclaimer: I do not own anything from the Dragon Ball universe. That privilege belongs to Akira Toriyama. And those bastards over at Disney own all of the MCU but not all the marvel comic characters.
