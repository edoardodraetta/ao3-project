Chapter Text CHAPTER 1 It was a good service. Or at least that’s what Peter heard someone say, as they made their way from the docks to the front porch of the Stark house. Tony Stark’s funeral had been strange. It was nice as far as funerals went, but everything seemed so unreal. Peter couldn’t believe that Ironman was really gone. He had no idea how the world was supposed to go on without him. Pepper had insisted that the avengers stay at the Stark house, until arrangements could be made for the avengers facility to be rebuilt. Peter still lived with his Aunt May, but they had decided that they would stay the night, and return to the city tomorrow. It was a mellow evening. Thor and Bruce drank on the balcony. Wanda and Sam played chess. Steve found himself looking at the pictures hanging in the hallway. He was surprised to see so many pictures of Tony with Peter. Tony had been devastated when he told Steve that Peter had vanished. He supposed he shouldn’t have been too surprised by the photos. As the night went on, people started making their way to their guest rooms. The Stark house was huge, but even so, there weren’t enough guest rooms to accommodate everyone. Peter, Steve and Wanda had volunteered to sleep on the couches. Peter and Steve took the two couches in the living room, while Wanda slept on the sectional in the adjacent den. That night, Steve woke in the middle of the night to a strange sound. His soldiers' reflexes had him on his feet in an instant. He took in his surroundings, and his eyes fell on Peter, who was shaking on the couch, crying and gasping. Steve used to have nightmares like that. Steve hesitated for a moment, before gently shaking Peter awake. Peter sat up, and stared at Steve for a moment, before choking on another sob. Steve lifted Peter off the couch, and carried him out the front door. There was no reason to wake up anyone else. He carried him to the porch swing, and sat down. “You’re okay,” Steve assured him. Peter curled into Steve's chest, crying softly. Steve ran his fingers through Peter's hair and rubbed his back while he cried. Steve continued to murmur soft comforting things to Peter as he held him. They stayed like that for a while, Peter sitting on Steve’s lap, with his face pressed into Steve’s neck. Steve resting his chin on Peter’s head. Soon Peter’s eyes are dry. “I’m sorry,” Peter whispers, his voice cracking with embarrassment. Placing a hand on Steve’s chest, he moves away so that he’s sitting on the swing next to him. “You don’t have to,” Steve said quietly. “I don’t mind.” Steve had been surprised by how comfortable he was holding the younger man. “I know,” Peter says softly. “I just… I should probably get some sleep.” Steve nodded, before standing up and following Peter back into the house. Peter lay back down on the couch, turning away from Steve. Steve laid down on his own couch. He laid his head against his pillow, and stared through the darkness at Peter’s small frame. An oddly familiar feeling swept over him, but Steve couldn’t place a name on the emotion. Peter lifted his head and turned to look over his shoulder at Steve. “Thank you,” he whispered into the darkness. Steve smiled as closed his eyes.
