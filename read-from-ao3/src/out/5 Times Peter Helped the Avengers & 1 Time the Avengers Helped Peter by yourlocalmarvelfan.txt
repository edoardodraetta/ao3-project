Chapter Text Peter swung into his room through the open window one evening after patrol, yawning despite the early hour. He sat down on his bed as he checked his phone for missed messages, tapping his watch to allow his suit to dissolve back into the mechanisms. “Peter?” FRIDAY’s voice came from the ceiling as he tapped out a quick reassurance of his well being to May. “What’s up, FRI?” Peter asked. “Sergeant Barnes appears to be having a flashback. Boss was fixing his arm and he appeared to become very agitated. Captain Rogers is away, and when Boss informed him, he recommended you.” Peter was up and out the door in seconds. If you had told him 2 years ago that one of his closest confidants would be James Barnes, he would have asked you who that was before laughing in your face. But here they were, and he and Bucky were like family. Steve, too. “FRIDAY, take me down to Bucky and Mr. Stark,” Peter said, getting into the elevator. FRIDAY shut the doors and whisked him down about 10 levels before the door opened. Peter quickly took in the scene around him. It had been a while since he had talked Bucky down from one of these. Usually Steve was home and took care of him. Tony was, thankfully, taking this seriously and was sitting at his work table with his hands folded where Bucky could see them. A second later, he spotted the Super Soldier in the shadows, seemingly keeping a close eye on Tony. His metal arm was obviously in the middle of being worked on. A few plates were missing and some wires were sticking out. Peter caught the exact moment Bucky clocked him, and put his hands out. “Bucky?” Peter asked softly. “What year is it?” “1943,” Bucky grunted, but he looked confused. “2020? No. That can’t be right. 1943,” he said, not sounding confident. “I’m Peter. Do you know me?” A nod. “Okay. You’re having a flashback, Buck. It’s okay. I know it feels real and it’s scary and you want to protect yourself, but it’s not real,” Peter said softly. “Can you look around and tell me 5 things you see?” As he talked, Peter walked slowly toward Bucky. “An Iron Man suit. A textbook. Blowtorch. Wire clippers. The blue couch,” Bucky said, looking more nervous than agitated now. “That’s great, Bucky,” Peter said, reaching the older man. “Can I touch your wrist?” he asked. Bucky nodded sharply. Peter took him by the wrist and placed his hand on his chest. “Follow my breathing. In through your nose and out of your mouth, okay?” Another nod. Peter breathed in, held his breath, and let it out slowly, and Bucky followed him. After a few minutes of that, Peter stepped back. “Are you feeling any better?” Bucky nodded. “Can you tell me what year it is and where you are?” “It’s… 2020, right? And I’m in your lab?” Bucky asked, still uncertain. “Yeah, that’s right. Mr. Stark was working on your arm and you got upset, that’s all. But the thing is, he didn’t get to finish. Do you want him to finish or should take over?” “You take over,” Bucky said. Peter nodded. “Okay. Mr. Stark, why don’t you head upstairs and get some food, because I know you haven’t eaten all day. I can handle this, and Buck and I will join you in a little bit?” Peter requested, knowing that Mr. Stark knew he wasn’t really asking. The mechanic nodded, standing up slowly and heading for the elevators. Once the doors closed, Peter turned back to Bucky. “Thanks, Pete. I don’t know… I don’t know where that came from,” Bucky said quietly. “Don’t worry about it. Can I ask you a few questions just to know where your head is at?” “Yeah, that’s fine,” Bucky said, sitting down in the chair next to him. “Okay. Do I need to ask to touch you still, or just ask about hugs?” “Just hugs.” “I can start working on your arm. Yes or no?” “Yes.” “Do you want me to talk while I work or should I just stay quiet?” “Umm… talk? I like your stories, kid. Maybe they’ll help take my mind off it,” Bucky said, nodding to his arm. “Okay. So today at school, I was talking to Ned and MJ, you know them…” Peter started, picking up the tools Mr. Stark had laid down and got to work. An hour or so later, the pair was in the elevator on the way to the main floor to get some dinner and watch a movie, per Peter’s suggestion. When they got to the kitchen, there was already takeout Thai waiting for them, so Bucky went to grab plates. While he was doing that, Peter quickly sent a message to Tony making sure he notified Steve about the events that had taken place earlier. Once he’d gotten a confirmation, he texted Steve just to let him know that he shouldn’t worry, it was all handled and they were settling down for dinner and a movie night. Right after that, his phone rang. Steve. Peter laughed and picked it up. “You’re sure he’s okay?” Steve asked the second the call connected. “Hi Uncle Steve, I’m good, thanks for asking.” “Peter,” Steve said in his don’t-test-me-I’m-Captain-America voice. “He’s fine. Truly. You know I wouldn't sugarcoat this. He’s really okay and this wasn’t even a bad one. It only took him a few minutes to come back. Unless the mission is over, don’t worry about coming home, okay?” “The mission just ended, we’re about to get in the air, I just wanted to make sure I didn’t need to fly faster.” “Don’t worry about it. We’re all good,” Peter reassured his Uncle for the millionth time. “Okay. As long as you’re sure.” “We’ll see you in the morning, Uncle Steve.” “See you then, kiddo,” Steve said, hanging up. “Steve was worried, I assume?” Bucky asked, walking back into the room. “Yeah. The mission was just finishing up, he’s headed home and wanted to make sure he didn’t need to move faster.” “Ah. Sounds like Stevie.” Bucky nodded. Peter walked to the fridge to grab a lemonade and behind him he heard Bucky sigh, so quietly he wouldn’t have heard it without his super hearing. “Can I hug you?” Peter asked, wandering back over to his Uncle(even though Bucky hated to be called Uncle, he just liked being called Bucky). “Sure. Hugging is okay now,” Bucky nodded. Peter didn’t hesitate to take him up on it, wrapping his arms around the super soldier. Bucky let out a puff of air that Peter assumed was a laugh as he hugged him back. After a second, the older man put his face in Peter’s hair. “You really do help, kid. I probably should say that more often. Thank you.” “Anytime,” Peter grinned. They stayed like that for a little bit longer before they migrated over to the couch to watch what Peter had decided would be Mary Poppins. A quiet classic. He knew Bucky had to be tired, he always was after a flashback, and they’d seen this movie a hundred times. He sat down next to him, giving him some space in case he needed it. “You’d better not be planning on sitting all the way over there, baby spider,” Bucky chuckled, extending his arm. Peter grinned, wriggling under it until they were squished together. Usually Steve would be on Bucky’s other side, falling asleep before the first 15 minutes were over. “I just wanted to give you options!” Peter insisted. “I’m okay now, Pete. Physical contact is a yes. I just needed to come fully back, you know? Don’t worry so much. That’s Stevie’s job,” Bucky told him, pressing play on the remote. An hour into the movie, the elevator opened, and in walked Steve Rogers himself. Both Peter and Bucky’s heads shot up. “I was going to surprise you two and rush back for movie night anyway, and I know it looks like I rushed home because of-- ooph. Hey, Buck. How’re you feeling?” Steve started, only interrupted when Bucky pulled him down on top of him. “Better now that you’re back. Missed you,” Bucky sighed, kissing Steve’s cheek before pressing play again. All three of them settled in to watch the movie again, but of course, as expected, Steve was the first to pass out. Unsurprisingly, Bucky fell asleep next. Once they were asleep, Peter laid a blanket over the two and went down the hall to his room. “Bucky okay?” Mr. Stark called from his room as Peter passed. “Yeah,” Peter smiled. “Bucky’s gonna be fine.”
